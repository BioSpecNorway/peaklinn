# A Universal Approach to Mie Scatter Correction in FTIR Analysis of Microsized Samples

This repository hosts a reference implementation of the PeakLiNN and ChemLiNN approaches for Mie scattering correction that were published in the paper "[A Universal Approach to Mie Scatter Correction in FTIR Analysis of Microsized Samples](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c07884)".

> [!NOTE]
> We are harmonizing our code base, so that it can be easily read and used. It will be gradually rolled out in the upcoming week. We expect to finish it before Christmas. Do not hesitate to contact if you are interested: uladzislau.blazhko@nmbu.no
